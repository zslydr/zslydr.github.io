# Renforcement Learning - 2048

Reinforcement learning to solve the 2048 game. The project begins with an implementation of a neural network. At first the inputs are the 4 $\times$ 4 grid of the game, and the outputs are given by the set of possible actions (there are four possible actions at each state of the game, up, down, right, left).
Two algorithms will be used to solve the neural network structures : 
- Basic genetic algorithm
- NEAT algorithm (Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies), which fits better the context of genetic evolution applied to neural networks.
