# Presentation

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Recently addicted to everything close enough to machine learning, I've decided to challenge myself through various projects, and try to explore every bit of ML algorithms I can find. I am mostly interested in direct applications with ML, such as AI and Data Science, but I also love digging into the actual mathematics and optimisation problems, and try to understand in depth the concepts behind it.

After getting my Master's degree in Statistics, my next journey is posting as many projects as I can on my github page, to mainly share my work to whoever would be interested in reading it or discuss it.
