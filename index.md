# Presentation

Recently addicted to everything close enough to machine learning, I've decided to challenge myself through various projects, and try to explore every bit of ML algorithms I can find. I am mostly interested in direct applications with ML, such as AI and Data Science, but I also love digging into the actual mathematics and optimisation problems, and try to understand in depth the concepts behind it.
